        <p><b style="font-size: 20px;">Artificial intelligence</b>  is a system that can solve a problem optimally. This means that the system can figure out alone what is the best action to take.

        <b style="font-size: 20px;">Why AI Now? </b>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            One of the greatest innovators in the field of machine learning was John McCarthy, widely recognized as the "Father of Artificial Intelligence".

In the mid 1950s, McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and defined it as "the science of making intelligent machines".

The algorithms has been here since then. Why is AI more intresting now?

                <li>Computing power has not been strong enough.</li>
                <li>Computer storage has not been large enough.</li>
                <li>Big data has not been available.</li>
                <li>Fast Internet has not been avaiable</li>
            </ul>

            Artificial intelligence is becoming good at many “human” jobs—diagnosing disease, translating languages, providing customer service—and it’s improving fast. This is raising reasonable fears that AI will ultimately replace human workers throughout the economy. But that’s not the inevitable, or even most likely, outcome. Never before have digital tools been so responsive to us, nor we to our tools. While AI will radically alter how work gets done and who does it, the technology’s larger impact will be in complementing and augmenting human capabilities, not replacing them.
            Certainly, many companies have used AI to automate processes, but those that deploy it mainly to displace employees will see only short-term productivity gains. In our research involving 1,500 companies, we found that firms achieve the most significant performance improvements when humans and machines work together. Through such collaborative intelligence, humans and AI actively enhance each other’s complementary strengths: the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantitative capabilities of the latter. What comes naturally to people (making a joke, for example) can be tricky for machines, and what’s straightforward for machines (analyzing gigabytes of data) remains virtually impossible for humans. Business requires both kinds of capabilities.
